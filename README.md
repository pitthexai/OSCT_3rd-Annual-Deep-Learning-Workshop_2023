# The 3rd Annual Deep Learning Workshop presented by The OSCT at Marquette University: March 24th, 2023

## Deep CNNs


Welcome to the 3rd Annual Deep Learning Workshop presented by The OSCT at Marquette University! My name is [Ahmad P. Tafti](http://aptafti.github.io), and I have the honor to serve as a guest speaker at the [3rd Annual Deep Learning Workshop presented by The OSCT at Marquette University](https://web.cvent.com/event/8071b458-dcec-406d-9a52-5100e0e1ba4c/summary).

I will be covering two topics, including: <strong> 1) Deep Learning in 10 Slides </strong> and <strong> 2) Deep CNN architectures and their applications in medical image segmentation </strong>.  The PDF files of these topics are available within the current GitHub repository. 

##  Hands-on-practice (Python)
The talk in Deep CNN architectures will include a hands-on-practice on image segmentation using a publicly and freely available dataset of [Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)](https://nda.nih.gov/oai). In the workshop, we will be ustilizing [<strong>Google Colab</strong>](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) equipped with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and GPUs to first develpo the pipeline, and then train, validate, and test the contructed models. Using Google Colab, you don't need to install any software/library packages, and as you know better than me, everything is just ready to use. Thanks much, Google! 

### Hands-on-practice using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)?
If you are going to take advantages of [<strong>Google Colab</strong>](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), and try to use this amzing collaborative environment for the proposed hands-on-practice, please follow the below steps, respectively. All we need is an stable internet connection and a browser! 


1) <strong> Dataset </strong>: Please down the dataset available in this repository. 

23) <strong>Code/Implementation</strong>: The code is also available in this GitHub repository.
